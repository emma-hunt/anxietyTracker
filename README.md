# anxietyTracker
Anxiety tracker is an app built for Fitbit which uses heartrate and activity data to detect when a user may be having increased anxiety.

This is a exploration of 'No UI' apps as explained by Golden Krishna in "The Best Interface is No Interface" <https://www.nointerface.com/>. 
Anxiety tracker is built on three principles:
  1. Apps should embrace the user's typical daily process and work while in your back pocket.
  2. Computers should serve us, not the other way around. Apps should be silent servants that require little interaction from the user.
  3. Apps should adapt to the individual. Apps should learn as we use them, both from our active input, as well as our passive use.
  
Anxiety tracker runs on a fitbit smart watch and learns the user's typical behavior to detect events which break established patterns.
The app learns the individual's typical heart rate range as correlated to various levels of activity. If the user's heart rate spikes when inactive, a state indeicitive of high stress,
it will notify a designated contact of the user's distress and advise support should be offered.
